The **Script** tab captures all interactions with Rattle as an *R
script*.

You can **Export** the script to file (e.g., *script.R*) to run
independently in R. 

To run a file as an R script use the command line like:

```
$ Rscript script.R
``` 

Within R itself, like the R Console or RStudio, run the command using:

```
source('script.R')
```
