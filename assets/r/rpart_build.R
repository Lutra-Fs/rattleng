# We begin most scripts by loading the required packages.  Here are
# some initial packages to load and others will be identified as we
# proceed through the script. When writing our own scripts we often
# collect together the library commands at the beginning of the script
# here.

# Load required packages from the local library into the R session.

# The 'rpart' package provides the 'rpart' function.

library(rpart)        # ML: decision tree rpart().

# For repeatable results.
