# The concept of templates for data science was introduced in my book,
# The Essentials of Data Science, 2017, CRC Press, referenced
# throughout this script as @williams:2017:essentials
# (https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science). On-line examples are
# available from my Data science Desktop Survival Guide

# We begin most scripts by loading the required packages.  Here are
# some initial packages to load and others will be identified as we
# proceed through the script. When writing our own scripts we often
# collect together the library commands at the beginning of the script
# here.

# Load required packages from the local library into the R session.

library(rattle)       # Access the weather dataset and utilities.
library(magrittr)     # Utilise %>% and %<>% pipeline operators.
library(janitor)      # Cleanup: clean_names() remove_constant().
library(tidyverse)    # ggplot2, tibble, tidyr, readr, purr, dplyr, stringr

# A pre-defined value for the random seed ensures that results are
# repeatable.

set.seed(42)
